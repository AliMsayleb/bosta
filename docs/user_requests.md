# user_requests
Takes a invite request from any MENA Devs member and pushes it to assigned admins for approval / rejection.

### Example Usage

```
@bosta invite (Marwan Smith) (marwan155329@gmail.com) (Software Engineer) (LBAS)

#> Output
Hey @bassem, we have received your invitation request for Marwan Smith and the admins are currently processing it. I'll keep you posted on its status! :wink:

Hello again @bassem, I'm afraid that your invitation request for Marwan Smith has been denied. This is either because the user has been invited already or an admin has rejected the request. If it's the latter an admin will be in touch with you soon to clarify the reason.
